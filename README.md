As majority of the student population in SIM uses telegram, this telegram bot serves as an alternative communications for the SIM community to reach out to Peer Mentors through telegram instead of instagram. Other than that, they could also find relevant information regarding Peer Mentors such as venue, contact information, or even redirecting to a professional counselling booking session.

Some of the features in v1.1:

/start -> Welcome message
/help -> Available commands
/motd -> Message of the day
/talktopm -> Schedule a session with a Peer Mentor
/counselling -> Schedule a session with our Counsellors
/swc -> Introduction to Student Wellness Center
/info -> SIM Peer Mentors' contact and information
/livechat -> Talk to SIM Peer Mentors (1-5 PM Weekdays only)
